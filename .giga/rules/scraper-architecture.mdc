### Base Architecture Components

#### BaseScraper Abstract Class (Importance: 95)
- Defines core scraping contract for cultural venue data extraction
- Implements Portuguese date parsing and category normalization
- Handles duplicate detection via composite event hashing
- Standardizes venue-specific data into common event format

Location: `scrapers/BaseScraper.php`

#### ScraperManager Orchestrator (Importance: 90)
- Coordinates execution of venue-specific scrapers
- Manages scraping lifecycle and error handling
- Consolidates extracted events into unified data store

Location: `scrapers/ScraperManager.php`

### Venue-Specific Implementations

#### GnrationScraper (Importance: 85)
- Handles dynamic content loading specific to GNRation cultural center
- Extracts structured event data from AJAX-loaded content
- Maps venue-specific categories to standardized taxonomy

Location: `scrapers/GnrationScraper.php`

#### TheatroCircoScraper (Importance: 85)
- Processes complex event hierarchies unique to Theatro Circo
- Extracts nested show information and sub-events

Location: `scrapers/TheatroCircoScraper.php`

#### CentesimaScraper (Importance: 80)
- Manages Angular-based content extraction
- Uses headless rendering for JavaScript-dependent content
- Implements specialized image extraction for gallery-style layouts
